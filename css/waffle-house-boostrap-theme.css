/*this CSS file themifies the core bootstrap elements with colors, textures, and other visual elements that fit waffle house
this file replaces bootstrap-theme.css
this file is a custom theme file, not unlike the files you'd find on bootswatch.com and wrapbootstrap.com
some of the css requires javascript to work - for example, certain animations. This javascript lives in waffle-house-bootstrap-theme.js
