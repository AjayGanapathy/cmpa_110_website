/*
this file contains custom angular directives. 
Angular directives are HTML <tag *attributes*> that instruct the browser to give angular control over the DOM element that the tag creates.

The directives in this file are either compound, complex, novel. Compound directives combine multiple existing angular directives into a single directive. Complex directives are heavily modified angular directives that could, but don't have to compound existing directives. Novel directives are completely new directives, built from scratch.
