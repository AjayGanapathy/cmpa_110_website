/*
This script defines custom angular directives, controllers, and services:
	Angular directives manipulate the DOM. They are bound to the DOM with corresponding HTML attributes. 
	Angular controllers manipulate data. They access data through angular services. 
	Angular services store data.  
Angular is an MVC framework. 
	Directives = view code
	Controllers = controller code
	Services = model code
This file is just the tip of the iceberg. The majority of angular directives, controllers, and services are pre-built.
